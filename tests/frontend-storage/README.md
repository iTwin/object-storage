.
|-- cypress
|   |-- tsconfig.json (1)
|-- backend.tsconfig.json (2)
|-- tsconfig.json (3)
```

1. `tsconfig.json` in `cypress` directory is used by `cypress` framework to transpile test and test helper files when running tests.
1. `backend.tsconfig.json` is used to transpile test running utilities that are imported by other CommonJS modules (storage packages).
1. `tsconfig.json` in root directory is only used to reference typings so that VS Code would not highlight the code as incorrect.
