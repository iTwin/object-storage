## About this Repository

This repository contains packages that expose a unified cloud-agnostic object storage interface.

- [`@itwin/cloud-agnostic-core`](./cloud-agnostic/core/README.md) is a base package that allows to load different components into an application using `inversify` based on the configuration.
- [`@itwin/object-storage-core`](./storage/core/README.md) package defines main interfaces for object storage.
- The following packages provide implementations of interfaces defined in `@itwin/object-storage-core` for specific cloud object storage providers:
  - [`@itwin/object-storage-azure`](./storage/azure/README.md) contains an implementation for Microsoft Azure.
  - [`@itwin/object-storage-s3`](./storage/s3/README.md) contains base implementation for S3-compatible storage providers. The following packages extend this package and adapt it to specific providers:
    - [`@itwin/object-storage-oss`](./storage/oss/README.md) contains an implementation for OSS.
    - [`@itwin/object-storage-minio`](./storage/minio/README.md) contains an implementation for MinIO.

This repository also contains packages that are relevant only for development:
- [`@itwin/object-storage-tests`](./tests/object-storage/README.md) contains integration tests that can be run using different storage implementations.
- [`@itwin/object-storage-common-config`](./utils/common-config/README.md) is a collection of various configuration files shared across the packages in this monorepo.
